# Sonder - A note taking app

This is a note taking app that I am building using React hooks. On the surface the App is a note taking app but my primary goal is to use this app to consolidate what I've learned about React into a single project. 


## Installing the and running the app

Sonder should run on localhost:3000 after installing and starting the app

`npm install`

`npm start`
